When installing packages for the frontend or backend make sure you are in the appropriate directory!

If you are a frontend dev make sure you are inside `client`

If you are a backend dev make sure you are inside `server`

If you want to start both the sever and the client run `npm run install` and `npm run dev` in the base directory;
